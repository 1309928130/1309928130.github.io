[Enshan](https://urbandesigntudelft.nl/team/enshan-chen/) is currently a PhD candidate in the urban design section of the urbanism department at the architecture faculty at TU Delft.

He holds a Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) degree from Chongqing University (2016) and an MSc from Tongji University (2021). He worked in Shanghai Tianhua Architecture Planning & Engineering doing projects of shopping malls and residential districts during 2016-2017.

Research interests
======

Enshan's research involves urban design, railway station development, mobility resilience, public space flexibility, agent-based simulation, and computer vision. His ongoing PhD project is titled ‘_Towards Fluctuation-supportive Station Areas - The Problems, assessment, and Guidelines_.’ This PhD project is transdisciplinary, with knowledge from urban design, crowd movement, environment psychology, and computer science. Currently, he is particularly interested in AI applications in design and exploring how large language models can support better urban analytics and computational design.
